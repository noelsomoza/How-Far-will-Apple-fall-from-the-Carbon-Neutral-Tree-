### About this project:
In 2020, after announcing their corporate operations were officially carbon neutral, Apple pledged to make their products carbon neutral by 2030. To achieve this goal, they set their emissions for 2015 (38.4 million metric tons CO2e) as the baseline and will aim to reduce them by 75% by 2030. The remaining 25% of gross emissions (9.6 million metric tons CO2e) will be removed using carbon offsets, bringing the net emissions to 0.

I worked from the perspective of an independent journalist and data viz enthusiast who was tasked to use the data provided by Apple in their Environmental Progress Reports to visualize their progress towards becoming carbon neutral in 2030.

### Goals
1) Identify Apple's trajectory as a company since launching its carbon-neutral initiative.
2) Identify specific areas within Apple's operations that are most carbon emission intensive.
3) Identify the scope and magnitude by which Apple has already reduced carbon emissions in this defined area.
4) Project Apple's ability to meet carbon emissions reduction and carbon offset goals by 2030.
5) Identify trends to maintain, increase, or reduce in specific emission types, categories, and descriptions.

### Major Findings
1) Progress towards environmental sustainability has not hindered growth. Between 2015-2022, Apple has reduced net emissions by 47.2% (17.8 million metric tons of CO2) while experiencing significant Market Cap, Employee, and Revenue growth.
2) During this 7-year period, the overwhelming majority, 98.53%, of gross emissions come from Apple's product life cycle. Meanwhile, corporate emissions constitute 1.47% of all gross emissions.
   Since Apple reached carbon-neutral corporate operations using carbon offsets as of 2021, progress towards the goal must be focused on significantly reducing emissions from the product life cycle.
3) The top 3 contributors to Product Life Cycle emissions are  manufacturing, product use, and product transportation. There is a cumulative reduction of 17.7 million metric tons of C02e emissions between
   2015 and 2022. Apple has made significant, targeted reductions in manufacturing, decreasing emissions by 54.7% and product use, decreasing emissions by 25.8%. However, product transportation emissions
   have increased by 46.2%.
5) Extrapolating trends from 2015-2022 data, projections to 2030 show Apple may fall short of reducing gross carbon emissions from their product life cycle by nearly 0.7 million metric tons of C02e, but
   most significantly, miss their carbon offset goal by 8.6 million metric tons.

### Action Steps
1) Apple's initiative is highly dependent on reducing manufacturing emissions. Reducing manufacturing emissions at a yearly rate of at least 1.4 million metric tons of CO2e per year is essential. Reducing
   manufacturing emissions to 2.5 million metric tons of C02e by 2030 could prove to be a massive undertaking.
2) Transportation emissions have increased by 46.7% since 2015 and are forecasted to keep growing, potentially reaching 2.5 million metric tons of C02e by 2030.  Reducing the rate of growth and eventually
   reducing transportation emissions overall must be prioritized.
3) Product use emissions have stagnated between 6.6 and 5.0 million metric tons of C02e in the past 7 years, a concern since product use emissions grew yearly between 2019 to 2021 after an initial yearly
   reduction from 2015 to 2019. Solutions to reduce product use emissions must be found to maintain a downward trend.
4) Apple must quickly put into place a scalable carbon offset program that shows they are capable of offsetting 9.6 million metric tons of C02e by 2030.
