About this project:
In 2020, after announcing their corporate operations were officially carbon neutral, Apple pledged to make their products carbon neutral by 2030. To achieve this goal, they set their emissions for 2015 (38.4 million metric tons CO2e) as the baseline and will aim to reduce them by 75% by 2030. The remaining 25% of gross emissions (9.6 million metric tons CO2e) will be removed using carbon offsets, bringing the net emissions to 0.

I worked from the perspective of an independent journalist and data viz enthusiast who was tasked to use the data provided by Apple in their Environmental Progress Reports to visualize their progress towards becoming carbon neutral in 2030.

Goals
1) Identify Apple's trajectory as a company since launching its carbon-neutral initiative.
2) Identify specific areas within Apple's operations that are most carbon emission intensive.
3) Identify the scope and magnitude by which Apple has already reduced carbon emissions in this defined area.
4) Project Apple's ability to meet carbon emissions reduction and carbon offset goals by 2030.
5) Identify trends to maintain, increase, or reduce in specific emission types, categories, and descriptions.
